# Tag observations with same values across variables (Stata)
Tagging observations where they contains the same values across a certain set of chosen variables.

The method uses an automated method that allows you to simply plug in the required variables on which you would like to tag observations that have similar values.

## Example of a data that is not tagged but contains values that are similar across var1 var2 var3 var4 and var5:

## We use 3 variables to check which observations have similar values in var1 var3 and var5:
